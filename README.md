# AdventOfCode2020

The goal is to put rust into practice by resolving problems from advent of code.

* Practicing **memoization** with rust to cache and reduce computation:
  * Use &hashmap to get the value by key, if not calculate it and store the input as key and output as value 
* Practicing object oriented concept with rust language:
  * **Encapsulation** - use of structs
  * **Inheritance** - not supported, by can be achieved using traits
  * **Polymorphism** - use of structs with trait 
  * **Abstraction** - use of traits, which define methods and not their implementation
* Practicing more about: 
  * **regex & match**
  * **iterator** - iterator: vector, adapter: map, consumer: consume
  * **generic**
  * **error handling** - Result<return, error>
  * **lifetime**
  * **closure** - receive fn as parameter

Rust has:
* **Reference** Types instead of classes
* **Macros** instead of reflection
* **Operator Overloading** instead of function overloading
